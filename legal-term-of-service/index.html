Feedback</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">To the extent you or any of your users provide any suggestions to CCPI regarding the functioning, features, and other characteristics of the Services, documentation, or other material or services provided or made available by CCPI (“Feedback”), you hereby grant CCPI a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid-up, fully transferable, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicenses) under all of your intellectual property rights, for CCPI to use and exploit in any manner and for any purpose.</p><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">14.4. Customer Name</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">During the term of this Agreement, you grant CCPI a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use and reproduce your trademarks, tradenames and logos in CCPI’s marketing materials and website(s) and to indicate that you are a CCPI customer. CCPI will abide by any written trademark usage guidelines provided by you. All goodwill arising out of the use of your trademarks, tradenames and logos shall inure to your benefit.</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">15. Payment of Fees</h2><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">15.1. Plans</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">The Services will be provided according to the plan level you select. There is a free hobby plan and there are paid self-service subscription plans (“self-service subscriptions”). For an enterprise license, you may contact CCPI separately. You may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other plan level that CCPI offers at any time during the period of your plan; provided that a downgrade will not be effective until the next renewal date. For self-service subscriptions, additional Services added to your self-service subscription, and domain registrations, you will be charged a fee and any applicable tax. Fees will be billed to the credit card or other payment account you provide in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You acknowledge and agree that CCPI will automatically charge your credit card or other payment account on record with CCPI in connection with your use of the Services: (i) in advance of each self-service subscription term, for the self-service subscription you have selected and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription; (ii) in arrears for any additional Services you have used or added to your self-service subscription during the prior self-service subscription term; and (iii) on purchase of any domain registration and up to thirty (30) days prior to each annual anniversary of your purchase. The self-service subscription and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription will automatically-renew for the same term as the initial term. You represent and warrant to CCPI that all of your payment information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. If payment is not received or cannot be charged to your credit card or other payment account for any reason in advance, CCPI reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Services and terminate this Agreement and for domain registrations, CCPI may not register the domain or may allow the domain registration to expire. All fees are non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement.</p><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">15.2. Payments</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">All payments shall be made in the currency of, and within the borders of the United States. You will pay all applicable taxes, duties, withholdings, backup withholding and the like; when CCPI has the legal obligation to pay or collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be paid by you directly to CCPI. If all or any part of any payment owed to CCPI under this Agreement is withheld, based upon a claim that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty between the U.S. and any such country, such payment shall be increased by the amount necessary to result in a net payment to CCPI of the amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement. You will reimburse CCPI any pre-approved and agreed upon costs. CCPI may change its fees and payment terms at its discretion; provided however, that such changes will not take effect for you until the start of the next payment period. CCPI will provide written notice to you for any changes to the fees that affect the Services purchased by you. Your continued use of the Services after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">16. Term and Termination</h2><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">16.1. Term</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">Subject to earlier termination as provided below, the term of this Agreement will commence on your acceptance of this Agreement and will continue for as long as the Services are being provided to you under this Agreement. The term of your hobby plan, self-service subscription, and any Services purchased or added to your self-service subscription, shall automatically renew for successive terms equal in duration to the initial term unless you cancel your hobby plan or self-service subscription in advance of the renewal date. You have the right to terminate your account (or downgrade your Pro account to a hobby account) at any time by sending a cancellation request to CCPI Support via the Help page provided that such termination will be effective at the start of the next renewal period. Subject to earlier termination as provided below, CCPI may terminate your account and this Agreement at any time by providing thirty (30) days prior notice to the administrative email address associated with your account. In addition to any other remedies CCPI may have, CCPI may also terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days’ notice (or two (2) days in the case of nonpayment), if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. CCPI may terminate your account and this Agreement immediately if you exceed any CCPI limits concerning use of the Services, including without limitation, the maximum period of time that data, code or other content will be retained by the Services, the maximum storage space that will be allotted on CCPI’s servers on your behalf, and the maximum compute capacity provided for the execution of builds and functions and the maximum network data transferred by the Services. You acknowledge that CCPI reserves the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time and the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof). All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently deleted by CCPI upon any termination of your account. If CCPI terminates your account without cause and you have signed up for a self-service subscription, CCPI will refund the pro-rated, unearned portion of any amount that you have prepaid to CCPI for such Services.</p><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">16.2. Survival</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, Sections 15.1 and 15.2, and accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">16.3. Effect of Termination</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason: (i) the licenses granted under this Agreement in respect of the Services shall immediately terminate and you and your users shall cease use of the Services; (ii) CCPI will cease providing any Support Services; (iii) you shall pay to CCPI the full amount of any outstanding fees due hereunder; and (iv) within fourteen (14) calendar days of such termination, each party shall destroy or return all Proprietary Information of the other party in its possession or control, and will not make or retain any copies of such information in any form, except that the receiving party may retain one (1) archival copy of such information solely for purposes of ensuring compliance with this Agreement</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">17. Disclaimer</h2><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">THE SERVICES AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND CCPI DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability</h2><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">18.1. Limit of Liability and Waiver of Consequential Damages</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">EXCEPT FOR YOUR BREACH OF SECTIONS 9, 14, AND 15, OR YOUR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OR YOUR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OR FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; OR (C) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES, OF LIABILITIES IN AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO CCPI FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT.</p><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">18.2. Limits</h3><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. IN THESE STATES, CCPI’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p><h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">19. Miscellaneous</h2><p style="font-size:18px;text-transform:none;color:#000000">CCPI may change this Agreement from time to time by providing notice either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice at https://CCPI.vn. You can review the most current version of this Agreement at any time at https://CCPI.vn/legal-terms-of-serive. The revised Agreement will become effective immediately after CCPI posts or sends you notice of such changes, and if you use the Services after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised Agreement. If any change to this Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to stop using the Services and send a cancellation email to CCPI Support via the Help page. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense without the prior written consent of CCPI, but CCPI may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without restriction. Any attempted assignment or transfer of this Agreement by the parties in contravention of the foregoing shall be null and void. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all amendments must be in writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. CCPI’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of that right. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.

email; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.Any delays in or failure of performance of CCPI shall not constitute a default hereunder or give rise to any claims for damages if, to the extent that, and for such period that, such delays or failures of performance are caused by any events beyond the reasonable control of CCPI including, without limitation, any of the following specific occurrences: acts of God or the public enemy, acts of terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, labor strikes, expropriation or confiscation of facilities, compliance with any unanticipated duly promulgated governmental order, acts of war, rebellion or sabotage or damage resulting therefrom, fires, floods, explosion, or riots.</p></div></div></div><div class="bg-white py-8 mb-8 mt-8"><div class="max-w-[800px] mx-auto p-8 px-4 border-t border-b border-gray-200"><div
