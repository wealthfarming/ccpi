//             The Services will be provided according to the plan level you select. There is a free hobby plan and there are paid self-service subscription plans (“self-service subscriptions”). For an enterprise license, you may contact CCPI separately. You may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other plan level that CCPI offers at any time during the period of your plan; provided that a downgrade will not be effective until the next renewal date. For self-service subscriptions, additional Services added to your self-service subscription, and domain registrations, you will be charged a fee and any applicable tax. Fees will be billed to the credit card or other payment account you provide in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You acknowledge and agree that CCPI will automatically charge your credit card or other payment account on record with CCPI in connection with your use of the Services: (i) in advance of each self-service subscription term, for the self-service subscription you have selected and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription; (ii) in arrears for any additional Services you have used or added to your self-service subscription during the prior self-service subscription term; and (iii) on purchase of any domain registration and up to thirty (30) days prior to each annual anniversary of your purchase. The self-service subscription and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription will automatically-renew for the same term as the initial term. You represent and warrant to CCPI that all of your payment information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. If payment is not received or cannot be charged to your credit card or other payment account for any reason in advance, CCPI reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Services and terminate this Agreement and for domain registrations, CCPI may not register the domain or may allow the domain registration to expire. All fees are non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement.

You will pay all applicable taxes, duties, withholdings, backup withholding and the like; when CCPI has the legal obligation to pay or collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be paid by you directly to CCPI. If all or any part of any payment owed to CCPI under this Agreement is withheld, based upon a claim that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty between the U.S. and any such country, such payment shall be increased by the amount necessary to result in a net payment to CCPI of the amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement. You will reimburse CCPI any pre-approved and agreed upon costs. CCPI may change its fees and payment terms at its discretion; provided however, that such changes will not take effect for you until the start of the next payment period. CCPI will provide written notice to you for any changes to the fees that affect the Services purchased by you. Your continued use of the Services after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.
